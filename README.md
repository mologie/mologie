Hi there, I'm Oliver! You will find me online by the aliases Mologie or Tri. This GitHub account of mine contains ramblings of technical nature, PoCs, and other personal projects worth archiving.

I currently work at [Authentic Vision GmbH](https://www.authenticvision.com/) in Salzburg as Head of Engineering, where we stop fraud using a copy-proof security label and accompanying mobile App and SDK.

### Personal Projects

* [talos-vmtoolsd](https://github.com/mologie/talos-vmtoolsd): Integrates the Talos Kubernetes distribution and VMware vSphere. Estimated to run on more than 2K machines based on GitHub-provided download statistics.
* [NXBoot](https://mologie.github.io/nxboot/) ([repo](https://github.com/mologie/NXBoot)): Starts arbitrary early boot code on vulnerable Nintendo Switch models from macOS and jailbroken iOS devices, using a custom IOKit-based implementation of Fusée Gelée. Still has ~100 active monthly users (down from 500 when launched in 2018). 

### Tooling

Proficient with Go / C++ / C / Obj-C / Git / K8s / VMware vSphere / Linux / macOS / networks / whiteboards / Google ;-). I edit code with Sublime Text / JetBrains IDEs / Xcode. Occasionally you'll find me using Swift / Kotlin / Java / Python / PostgreSQL / HTML+CSS+JS / LaTeX, and reverse engineer software with IDA and Hopper.
