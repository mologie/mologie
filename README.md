Hi there, I'm Oliver! You will find me online by the aliases Mologie or Tri. This GitHub account of mine contains ramblings of technical nature, PoCs, and other personal projects worth archiving.

I currently work at [Authentic Vision GmbH](https://www.authenticvision.com/) in Salzburg as Head of Engineering, where we stop fraud using a copy-proof security label and accompanying mobile App and SDK.

### Personal Projects

* [talos-vmtoolsd](https://github.com/mologie/talos-vmtoolsd): Integrates Talos K8s and VMware vSphere on thousands of machines. The project was migrated into the official Sidero Labs GitHub org in 2024 and is currently maintained by Equinix NL.
* [NXBoot](https://mologie.github.io/nxboot/) ([repo](https://github.com/mologie/NXBoot)): Starts early boot code on first-gen Nintendo Switch consoles from macOS and liberated iOS devices, using a custom IOKit-based implementation of Fusée Gelée. Has several hundred active monthly users.
* [nicecmd](https://github.com/mologie/nicecmd): A Go library for building command line tools. It is a frontend for Cobra, the most common CLI library in the Go ecosystem, and avoids its verbose API. I hope that this utility of mine gains some traction eventually, it's quite new.
