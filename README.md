Hi there, I'm Oliver! You will find me online by the aliases Mologie or Tri. This GitHub account of mine contains ramblings of technical nature, PoCs, and other personal projects worth archiving.

I currently work at [Authentic Vision GmbH](https://www.authenticvision.com/) in Salzburg as Head of Engineering, where we stop fraud using a copy-proof security label and accompanying mobile App and SDK.

### Personal Projects

* [talos-vmtoolsd](https://github.com/mologie/talos-vmtoolsd): Integrates the Talos Kubernetes distribution and VMware vSphere. Estimated to run on more than 2K machines based on GitHub-provided download statistics.
* [NXBoot](https://mologie.github.io/nxboot/) ([repo](https://github.com/mologie/NXBoot)): IOKit-based implementation of Fusée Gelée, which starts arbitrary early boot code on vulnerable Nintendo Switch models from macOS and jailbroken iOS devices.

### Legacy Projects

I used to develop system extensions for jailbroken iOS devices. These stopped working a long time ago as Apple updated iOS, but were installed onto over 100K devices before that:

* [ClipShot](https://github.com/mologie/clipshot) allowed copying screenshots to your device clipboard before it was cool
* [VisualAlertSwitch](https://github.com/mologie/visualalertswitch) plus [RingerEvents](https://github.com/mologie/ringerevents) would allow rigging up the mute switch to the camera LED notification feature through Activator
* [BetterPasscodeKeypad](https://github.com/mologie/betterpasscodekeypad) would make it harder for shoulder surfers to read your PIN back when there was no FaceID/TouchID.

Some [macOS kernel hackery](https://github.com/mologie/NVWebDriverLibValFix) fixed compatibility of external GPUs with macOS 10.12 (and the fix is now maintained in [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)). Beyond that, there is a whole bunch of software back from my involvement with [Soldat.pl](https://soldat.pl/en/)/[OpenSoldat](https://github.com/opensoldat) and early web development/consulting work.
